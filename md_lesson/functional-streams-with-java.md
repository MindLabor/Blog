Often, when you’re about to implement some complex stuff, things can become confusing really quickly. 
So it is important to write clean code. A way of many is to use streams. Not the Java Stream API but the concept of a stream.
			
## 1. Creating a class
Take the example mentioned above and name the class “Train”. It has the following variables: people, fuel, timePast and trainDriver.

```js
console.log(`This is Javascript!`);
```

## 2. Creating the functionality
As the train moves, the fuel level decreases. So we should be able to refill the tank again. 
We also want to pick up people on the way. Here are some methods we could include: enter, leave, fillfuel, changeDriver, etc.

```java
public void start() {
  test += 900f;
}
```

Streams can be very useful, especially when you’re implementing complex logic and want to have a clear structure and clean code. You might not want to use streams in a big loop though, 
since there are very slow compared to a direct implementation. In all other cases, go ahead and try it out yourself.
